Hello and welcome to the home page of Ryan Coding Solutions (RCS). My name is Kevin Ryan and I founded RCS earlier this year with the remit to work with charity/commercial/industry partners in providing coding solutions to help develop and streamline their operational processes and pipelines. Having previously worked within both academia and the NHS as a Bioinformatician I am an experienced programmer who has worked at the cutting edge of big data systems primarily within the Genetics field. This has included implementing a fully automated analysis pipeline to support the main DNA sequencing facility at Guy's Hospital Gentics Service which serves 3.8 million people in the South East Thames area. I am currently completing a part-time MSc in Data Science at City, University of London having won a Computer Science Scholarship awarded to high calibre students on the programme. I am also currently working towards graduating from the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree programme by Udacity. Please see my CV at www.cv.ryancodingsolutions.com for more details. I am a keen advocate of the democratization of coding and data science frameworks to enable us as a community to embrace the amazing potential our fast-moving technological landscape has to offer us in helping us to change our everyday lives. I am keen to work with you on your project whether it is to help develop a website to get your business off the ground or larger projects involving how best to integrate data streams to improve your platform's utility for your customer and employees. Please contact me with any questions at kevin@ryancodingdesign.com
